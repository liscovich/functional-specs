<h2 id="anamersaudienceaudiencea"><a name="RSAudience">Audience</a></h2>

<p>The Researcher Site is used by experimental social scientists, who use experiments to understand human behavior. These researchers come from many different backgrounds, including the fields of economics, political science, psychology, and sociology, as well as corporations and think tanks. </p>

<p>Most of these researchers currently use <a href="http://www.iew.uzh.ch/ztree/index.php">z-Tree</a>, software from the 1990s that requires researchers to learn how to program. Researchers are accustomed to bare-bones UI for both themselves and their subjects. These researchers typically know a limited amount of programming and are open to technologically complex tools, since much of their work relies on technology such as <a href="www.stata.com">STATA</a>, <a href="http://www.iew.uzh.ch/ztree/index.php">z-Tree</a>, and <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>

<p>Users fall into two typical use cases: </p>

<ol>
<li>The Experiment Designer</li>
<li>The Trial Runner</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="professorgoldintheexperimentdesigner">1. Professor Goldin, the Experiment Designer</h3>

<p>Professor Goldin is an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. For over ten years, she has used <a href="http://www.iew.uzh.ch/ztree/index.php">z-Tree</a>, the dominant social science experiments software, to study human behavior. She knows a rudimentary amount of programming&#8211;just enough to design experiments in z-Tree. Each trial takes several weeks to run, and much of this time is spent handling logistics: recruiting subjects, waiting for subjects, screening subjects, reserving computer lab space at the university&#8217;s social science experiments facility, and ensuring that subjects are paid. </p>

<p>Professor Goldin hears about Popper at an Experimental Economics Conference and visits <a href="www.popper.org">www.popper.org</a>. On the <strong>Landing Page</strong>, she reads about how Popper works and signs up for an account. She downloads the Popper SDK and reads through the Popper documentation. The first trial that she runs uses one of the stock experiments available publicly. She makes a few changes to the experiment design in <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>, which is provided as part of the Popper SDK. Once she finishes designing the experiment to her satisfaction, Professor Goldin asks her research assistant, Robert, to run trials using this experiment. </p>

<p>Soon, Professor Goldin begins designing her own experiments from scratch using templates from the Popper SDK and assets downloaded from the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/asset-store/">Unity Asset Store</a>. Popper takes care of logistical and technical issues so that Professor Goldin can focus on her research rather than tedious overhead. Her trials now take hours, rather than weeks, to run. </p>

<h3 id="robertthetrialrunner">2. Robert, the Trial Runner</h3>

<p>Robert is a research assistant working for the economics department at Carnegie Mellon University. His job this summer is to run trials and crunch data for Professor Goldin. Robert knows no programming but has taken a few statistics courses. Professor Goldin asks him to set up an account at www.popper.org. He signs up on the <strong>Landing Page</strong> and follows a set of simple instructions to create an account. Robert links Professor Goldin&#8217;s laboratory GitHub account with his Popper account, and is able to find the lab&#8217;s private experiments on the <strong>Experiments Library</strong> page. He selects one of the experiments and fills in a set of parameters for who is allowed to participate in the trial and the type of data he would like to collect. Robert clicks Create Trial, and eligible subjects are automatically recruited from Amazon MTurk and oDesk. He monitors the progress of the trial on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page. A few hours later, the trial is complete and Robert downloads the data to analyze further. </p>

<h2 id="anamelooklookandfeela"><a name="Look">Look and Feel</a></h2>

<p>The site serves an academic audience so the overall look of the <strong>Landing Page</strong> should be classic yet modern, and convey academic legitimacy. We are leaning towards a light, clean color scheme.</p>

<h2 id="anamersaccountsaccountsa"><a name="RSAccounts">Accounts</a></h2>

<!---A GitHub account is necessary for the following three reasons. 

1. GitHub eliminates the need to implement standard workflows on our side, like log in and password retrieval. 
2. We would like to encourage users to collaborate on experiments, and GitHub provides convenient tools for sharing and discussing code.
3. Using a GitHub account, all users can push experiments.
-->

<p>The Researcher Site requires users to have a GitHub account and authenticates them via GitHub OAuth API. In addition to the GitHub profile information, the following data are stored for each of the users: </p>

<ul>
<li>First name</li>
<li>Last name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Department and affiliation</li>
<li>Payment method (credit card/PayPal)</li>
<li>Activity history on the Site (list of created trials, list of experiments recommended by the user)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anamesign_upasignup"><a name="Sign_Up"></a>Sign up</h3>

<p>There are two ways for unregistered users to Sign Up:</p>

<ol>
<li>By clicking on the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button in the Navigation Bar.</li>
<li>By being redirected to Sign Up after logging in with GitHub.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sign Up consists of three steps. Only one step is displayed at a time so that users are not overwhelmed. </p>

<h4 id="step1:emailconfirmation">Step 1: Email Confirmation</h4>

                <a name="Sign_Up_2_3a"></a><li>b. &nbsp; If the user clicks Sign Up, he or she is taken to the GitHub Sign Up page to create a free account at <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">https://github.com/signup/free</a> <i>in a new browser tab.</i> Once the user has signed up, he or she can close the GitHub tab and log in using GitHub from the Researcher Site Sign Up page. The workflow proceeds from part <a href="#3a">3a</a> above.</li>
            </ul>   
        <li>4. &nbsp; The user authorizes Popper to access the user's public and private information, including all repositories.</li>
            <!---This authorization is necessary to customize the user's **Experiments Library** so that the users's own public and private experiments are displayed. The only way to run a trial is through the **Experiments Library**, which means that Popper must be able to access both public and private repositories. Experiments from public repositories are visible to all users, while experiments from private repositories are visible only to users who have GitHub access to that repository.-->  
        <li>5. &nbsp; The user is redirected to the Sign Up page, which features the same design but different content.</li>

<h4 id="anamesign_up_3astep3:profilecompletion"><a name="Sign_Up_3"></a>Step 3: Profile Completion</h4>

<ol>
<li>The user provides the following information:

<ul>
<li>First name</li>
<li>Last name</li>
<li>Department and affiliation
<p>Users enter their affiliation using autocomplete. If their institution is not found from our provided list, the user simply finishes typing the affiliation. Names of departments and affiliations need to be scraped from <a href="http://edirc.repec.org/alphabet.html">http://edirc.repec.org/alphabet.html</a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The user clicks &#8220;Submit&#8221; and is doing so indicates agreement to the Popper Terms of Service, which we will provide. The Terms of Service should open in a popup window.</li>
<li>The user is redirected to the <a href="#RSDashboard">Dashboard</a>.</li>
</ol>

<!---First and Last Name are required because GitHub does not ask users to input their first and last names separately, and we want to make sure that we have the full names of all users.-->

<h3 id="login">Log In</h3>

<p>The Log In process is tied closely to the Sign Up page. You&#8217;ll recall that Sign Up requires three components: email verification, a linked GitHub account, and affiliation details. Logging in includes a series of checks in the backend to make sure that a user account includes all three components.</p>

<p>The below diagram shows how Log In works and how it is connected to Sign Up. We will now take a look at what happens from the moment the user clicks <strong>Log In</strong> from the Navigation Bar. </p>

<h2 id="anamerslanding_pagealandingpage"><a name="RSLanding_page"></a>Landing page</h2>

<p>The <strong>Landing Page</strong> introduces users to Popper. The primary action that a user takes is to <a href="#Sign_Up">sign up</a>. </p>

<p>This page consists of seven components: </p>

<ol>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Navigation Bar</li>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>Usage Statistics</li>
<li>Features</li>
<li>Sign Up (Verify Email)</li>
<li>Footer</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://github.com/liscovich/functional-specs/blob/master/images/landingpage.png?raw=true" width="100%"></p>

<h3 id="logo">1. Logo</h3>

<!---pic-->

<p><img src="https://github.com/liscovich/functional-specs/blob/master/images/lplogo.png?raw=true" width="100%"></p>

<p>The Popper Logo contains the word &#8220;Popper&#8221; accompanying a stylized image of the philosopher Karl Popper. The ideal portrait for this logo is available <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Karl_Popper.jpg">here</a> in the public domain from Wiki Commons. </p>

<!---   <IMG SRC="https://github.com/liscovich/functional-specs/blob/master/images/popper_eyes.png?raw=true" width="100%" ALT="POPPER_EYES" ALIGN="RIGHT">
    </center>
-->

<p>We would like to include Karl Popper&#8217;s likeness to clarify the origin of the name &#8220;Popper&#8221; and dissociate alternative meanings of the word. The logo should be designed to stand out well against both the light background of the Researcher Site and the dark background of Unity3D, a core component of the Popper SDK. </p>

<p>The font of the logo should be classical and convey both authority and legitimacy, much like the logos of universities and research software.</p>

<!---logo images here-->

<p>Finally, the logo should have a corresponding smaller &#8220;minilogo&#8221; that appears in the browser title bar. This minilogo should be a &#8220;P&#8221; that corresponds stylistically with the Popper logo.</p>

<p>When a user is not signed in, clicking on the Popper Logo brings the user to the <a href="#RSLanding_page">Landing Page</a> at <a href="http://www.popper.org">www.popper.org</a>. Once the user signs in, clicking on the Popper Logo brings the user to the <a href="#RSDashboard">Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>The Navigation Bar in the Header includes four links: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How It Works</strong></li>
<li><strong>Our Story</strong></li>
<li><strong>Experiments Library</strong></li>
<li><strong>Log in</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>[1] <strong>How It Works</strong> links to documentation for Popper. Documentation is stored on GitHub, not on the Researcher Site. Clicking on <strong>How It Works</strong> takes the Researcher to a public repository linked with the official <a href="https://github.com/Experiments/">Popper GitHub account</a>. We will take care of writing documentation.</p>

<p>[2] <strong>Our Story</strong> is a static About page. Its contents will be discussed later.</p>

<p>[3] <strong>Experiments Library</strong> is a dynamic page on the Popper Research Site that allows researchers to browse experiments, and will be discussed later.</p>

<p>[4] User log in and sign up were discussed in the previous section, &#8220;Accounts&#8221;. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="overview">3. Overview</h3>

<!---pic-->

<p>The purpose of the Overview is to describe Popper briefly. We anticipate that initially, most users who come to <a href="www.popper.org">www.popper.org</a> will know little to nothing about Popper. The most that users might know is that Popper is a tool that lets social scientists run experiments. </p>

<p>The header of the <strong>Landing Page</strong> is <code>&#8220;Behavioral Experiments Platform, [a(n) adjective] one&#8221;</code>. We would like to replace the <code>[a(n) adjective]</code> with a revolving list of serious and funny words. We are unsure from a UX perspective whether it would be more pleasant to have the words automatically refresh every few seconds or if it would be better for the user to click a small &#8220;refresh&#8221; icon next to the <code>[a(n) adjective]</code> to make the word change.</p>

<p>Here is the list of words &#8211; we would like for the succession of words to be random but the first word that appears when the user arrives on the <strong>Landing Page</strong> should always be a word from the Serious list. </p>

<p><strong>Serious</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>an agile</li>
<li>a modern</li>
<li>a versatile</li>
<li>a cutting-edge</li>
<li>a customizable</li>
<li>an addictive</li>
<li>an advanced</li>
<li>a promising</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Funny</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a fat-free</li>
<li>a low cholesterol</li>
<li>a low emissions</li>
<li>a PG&#8211;13</li>
<li>a lactose intolerant</li>
<li>a free range</li>
<li>a whole wheat</li>
<li>a hormone free</li>
<li>an antibiotic free</li>
<li>a TSA-compliant</li>
<li>a pasteurized</li>
</ul>

<p>Underneath the header is a short paragraph explaining what Popper is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Popper is a powerful blend of modern technology and social science. Using Popper, you can design complex cutting-edge experiments using the most advanced tools in existence. You can also run large-scale online trials drawing subjects from the world&#8217;s deepest on-demand subject pool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="usagestatistics">4. Usage Statistics</h3>

<!---pic-->

<p>We would like to include usage statistics to boost the legitimacy of Popper among researchers. This portion of the <strong>Landing Page</strong> should be located directly under the Hook. Three statistics should be dynamically displayed and updated: the number of researchers, the number of deployed experiments, and the number of completed trials. The focus is on the numbers, which means that these digits should stand out much more than the names of what the numbers are counting. These statistics will only be available once Popper gains traction, which means that it would be ideal for there to be a way for us to activate this section of the site only once we have compelling statistics to show. This means that the <strong>Landing Page</strong> should visually &#8220;work&#8221; even if the statistics portion of the page is not shown. </p>

<h3 id="features">5. Features</h3>

<!---pic-->

<p>After the user gets some sense of what Popper is, the Features List provides a more detailed explanation of why the user should make the decision to Sign Up. The Features List describes four core selling points of Popper:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start at the Frontier</p></li>
<li><p>Program the Way You Think</p></li>
<li><p>Run When You Are Ready</p></li>
<li><p>Leave Logistics to Us</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These four features should be arranged on a horizontal navigation panel. Each of the four phrases should be accompanied by an image, which we will provide. Underneath the navigation panel is a frame split in half vertically, with text in the left panel and an image in the right panel. As the user clicks on each of the four features, the contents of the frame change. We are currently deciding on the four sets of text and images to place into this frame. Below is a draft of what we would like to include in the frame. </p>

<h4 id="startatthefrontier">Start at the frontier</h4>

<p>Begin running experiments right away. Browse the Experiments Library to find the best existing experiments. Share, discuss, and collaborate on best-practice experiment design effortlessly with a community of professionals. Retrieve the entire experiment protocol for any publicly available experiment 24/7 from our servers. Best of all, replicating an experiment only requires three clicks. </p>

<p>Popper relies on frontier technology, which means that it improves daily. </p>

<h4 id="programthewayyouthink">Program the Way You Think</h4>

<p>Design experiments using intuitive visual programming. Popper comes equipped with domain-specific nodes, custom-tailored for behavioral experiments. Easily automate common experiment tasks using one of our templates. Popper features full Mathematica support for computationally-intensive functionality. Those with more programming experience can delve past visual programming into the C# code underlying all experiments. </p>

<h4 id="runwhenyouareready">Run When You Are Ready</h4>

<p>Draw from our on-demand online subject pool. Without the physical restraints of a lab, subjects can participate from the comfort of their homes, when you need them to. Deploy experiments in minutes, without worrying about searching and coordinating eligible subjects. </p>

<h4 id="leavelogisticstous">Leave Logistics to Us</h4>

<p>Popper is built on a secure cloud infrastructure of servers, which means that you can focus on science rather than logistics. We handle all technical overhead related to subjects, from recruitment to screening to payment. We also provide an archive of IRB experiment-specific approvals for your convenience to expedite your own IRB approval process. </p>

<h3 id="signupverifyemail">6. Sign Up (Verify Email)</h3>

<!---pic-->

<p>Users can begin the sign up process by entering their email in this field for verification. Read more about the sign up process in the previous section, &#8220;Accounts&#8221;. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="footer">7. Footer</h3>

<!---pic-->

<p>The Popper footer contains secondary navigation and is divided into two components: general links and legal miscellany. The general links are divided into three vertical columns. The first column, &#8220;Popper&#8221;, includes links to &#8220;Our Story&#8221;, &#8220;Blog&#8221;, and &#8220;Contact&#8221;. The second and third columns include links to Documentation. We have not yet fleshed out the Documentation of Popper enough to know how many distinct links this section will include. </p>

<p>The second half of the footer is comprised of links that run horizontally along the bottom of the page. These links are &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221;, &#8220;Privacy&#8221;, and &#8220;Security&#8221;. Under these links is the text <code>&#8220;&copy; 2012 Popper. All Rights Reserved.&#8221;</code> On the right side of this part of the footer is the Fixel logo, with the text <code>&#8220;Designed by Fixel&#8221;</code>.</p>

<p>The Sign Up and Log In pages feature the same Logo, Navigation Bar, and Footer as the <strong>Landing Page</strong> and <em>Our Story</em>*</p>

<h2 id="anamersour_storyaourstory"><a name="RSOur_story"></a>Our story</h2>

<p>The <strong>Our Story</strong> page is a static About page. It explains who Karl Popper is and introduces the Popper team.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong> features the same Header and Footer as the <strong>Landing Page</strong>. On the left is a photo of Karl Popper taken by Lucinda Douglas-Menzies. This photo should be cropped as necessary to work with the overall design of the page. We were able to secure rights to use this photo, provided we give credit to the photographer. Under the cropped photo should be the text, <code>&#8220;&copy; Lucinda Douglas-Menzies&#8221;</code> and <code>&#8220;Reproduced with the generous permission of the photographer&#8221;</code>. </p>

<p>To the right of Karl Popper&#8217;s likeness, we would like to include a section called <code>&#8220;Behind the Name&#8221;</code> and, beneath it, <code>&#8220;Team&#8221;</code>. We are currently working on this text and will provide it once it is ready. For now, we anticipate that the text in each section will not be more than two paragraphs long. </p>

<p>We would like the other static pages on the Researcher site to feature the same wrapper as <strong>Our Story</strong>. These other pages are <strong>Contact</strong>, <strong>Terms of Service</strong>, <strong>Privacy</strong>, and <strong>Security</strong>. <strong>Terms of Service</strong>, <strong>Privacy</strong>, and <strong>Security</strong> should open up in popup windows.</p>

<h2 id="anamersexperimentsaexperiments"><a name="RSExperiments"></a>Experiments</h2>

<p><strong>Experiments Library</strong> is the final page accessible to users who are not signed in from the <strong>Landing Page</strong>. The page includes a few additional features once a user has signed in. These differences will be noted below when relevant.</p>

<p>There are five main components in <strong>Experiments Library</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Navigation Bar</li>
<li>Footer</li>
<li>List of Experiments</li>
<li>Search Bar</li>
<li>Filter</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="logo">1. Logo</h3>

<p>Same as <strong>Landing Page</strong>. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="navigationbar">2. Navigation Bar</h3>

<p>A logged in user sees &#8220;Dashboard&#8221; where the &#8220;Our Story&#8221; link used to be. The &#8220;Log In&#8221; link is replaced by the user&#8217;s email address, which opens out to a menu with the options &#8220;Profile&#8221; and &#8220;Log Out&#8221;. <!---internal links--> Log Off signs the user off Popper and brings the user back to the <strong>Landing Page</strong>. A message telling the user that Log Out has been completed is not necessary: the user will know that log out is successful because the email address in the top right hand corner will once again be replaced by the &#8220;Log In&#8221; link.</p>

<p>A logged out user sees the same Navigation Bar as the logged-out version described on the <strong>Landing Page</strong>. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="footer">3. Footer</h3>

<p>Same as <strong>Landing Page</strong>. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="listofexperiments">4. List of Experiments</h3>

<p>The main feature of <strong>Experiments Library</strong> is a list of public experiments. All users can see this list, no matter if they are logged in or not. The idea is to allow researchers to be able to see what Popper offers without having to sign up first. The list of experiments is an embedded frame with a scrollbar. We would like to display three experiments per row.</p>

<p>This frame displays two sections of experiments: User Experiments and Stock Experiments, in this order. User Experiments are pulled from the user&#8217;s GitHub repositories, which means that experiments contained in public repositories are visible to all other users and those from private repositories are visible only to someone who has GitHub access to that repository. A user would typically keep a repository private while the experiment is still being developed and then make the repository public once an accompanying paper has been published and the experiment is open for peer review and replication. </p>

<p>Stock Experiments are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/Experiments/">Popper GitHub account</a> and can be public or private. Stock Experiments allow researchers to run experiments right away, without having to design their own experiments from scratch. This is particularly important when Popper launches because no users will have designed their own experiments yet. Stock Experiments also provide researchers with templates of the most commonly run experiments in the social sciences. </p>

<p>Popper reads through the content of a user&#8217;s repositories and pulls only the ones that contain full experiments. Popper makes this determination by looking for metadata, source code, master client, and client files. If the user&#8217;s GitHub account does not contain any experiments, &#8220;No experiments pushed to GitHub. Click <a href="linktodocumentation.com">here</a> to learn how to design experiments.&#8221; should be displayed in the section for User Experiments. &#8220;Here&#8221; links to Popper documentation on the <a href="https://github.com/Experiments/">Popper GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>These experiments are sorted by date&#8211;repositories with the most recent changes are displayed first. The name of the repository (functioning as the name of the experiment), a description of the experiment, number of forks, and the academic journal in which the results of the experiment were published should be listed. The number of forks is necessary to list and include in the metadata because researchers may want to sort experiments by popularity, which is functionality we would like to include in the future once more experiments are available in <strong>Experiments Library</strong>. </p>

<p>When a researcher hovers over an experiment, the square containing the name of the experiment and its information should change color. Clicking on the experiment brings the user to the <strong>Experiment</strong> page (formerly known as <strong>Create Trial</strong>) for that particular experiment, where the user can learn more about the experiment and create a trial. </p>

<h3 id="searchbar">5. Search bar</h3>

<p>The search bar sifts through the contents of the List of experiments. As soon as a researcher begins to type, autocomplete suggestions should appear beneath the Search bar, in the style of Google search. When a researcher clicks on an experiment in the autocomplete list, that single experiment alone is displayed in the List of experiments. If the researcher instead hits Enter, a list of all experiments relevant to the search phrase will appear in the List of experiments, split up into the two sections mentioned above (User Experiments, Stock Experiments). </p>

<p>Autocomplete search results should be formatted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Name of Experiment</strong> - Description of experiment, truncated after a certain number of characters so that the number of forks and publication journal can appear at the end of the autocomplete suggestion&#8230; - <em>Forks: ##</em>; <em>Journal Name</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="filter">6. Filter</h3>

<p>Researchers can also search for an experiment by browsing with the filter, in the style of navigating with the left navigation bar to find a product on <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. </p>

<p>[insert explanation of filters here, Andrey&#8230;]</p>

<p>At the same time, the frame to the right of the Filter should update if necessary to be populated with all experiments that match that filter, organized by section (User Experiments and Stock Experiments). If a user selects an experiment in the Filter, that experiment should be highlighted in the Filter and the Experiment List frame should update to display only that experiment, as well as the section that the experiment falls under (User Experiments and Stock Experiments).</p>

<h2 id="anamersdashboardadashboard"><a name="RSDashboard"></a>Dashboard</h2>

<p>Researchers monitor trials in the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. The <strong>Dashboard</strong> consists of two main components: </p>

<ol>
<li>Trials</li>
<li>Feed</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="trials">1. Trials</h3>

<p>Trials is a list of all of the researcher&#8217;s trials, both complete and ongoing. A trial enters this list as soon as a researcher clicks &#8220;Create Trial&#8221; on the <strong>Create Trial</strong> page, which will be discussed later. Clicking on the name of a trial brings the researcher to the <strong>Trial Summary</strong> page for that trial, which includes all parameters and actions specific to a particular trial. This page will be discussed later. </p>

<p>Trials are sorted by activity date, which means that the most recently active trials appear at the top of the list. Trials can be in one of five statuses, and a change in status consitutes &#8220;activity&#8221; that pushes a trial to the top of the list. These statuses are displayed underneath the name of the trial, as shown in the wireframe. The five statuses are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Awaiting players: The initial status of all trials that a researcher creates is &#8220;Waiting for players&#8221;. This status indicates that the trial has been created and that the server is waiting for a sufficient number of subjects to join the game. The researcher can click on the name of the trial to go to that trial&#8217;s <strong>Trial Summary</strong> page to recruit more subjects if necessary.</li>
<li>In progress: Once enough subjects have joined a trial, the status of the trial changes to &#8220;In progress&#8221;. Subjects play the game, and as they do, data from the experiment is sent to the <strong>Trial Summary</strong> page.</li>
<li>Pay subjects: Once a trial is complete, the researcher pays subjects. The researcher can review and approve subject payments from the <strong>Trial Summary</strong> page.</li>
<li>Complete: After payment is complete, the status of the trial changes to &#8220;Complete&#8221;. No further action is required from the researcher at this time, but the trial is saved in the List for the researcher to review and download data.</li>
<li>Error: If there is an error with any part of the trial, the researcher can click on the trial to go to <strong>Trial Summary</strong> in order to fix the error.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to the status of the trial, two other pieces of information about the trial are displayed next to the name of the trial. </p>

<ul>
<li>Trial number: Each trial is assigned a unique ID number. This number is necessary to keep track of trials and allows us to help users resolve issues with individual trials.</li>
<li>Date and time: A timestamp corresponding with when the change in status occurred is displayed next to the name of the trial. These time stamps are important and informative for each status. For example, when a trial is first created, the time stamp in &#8220;Trial&#8221; would indicate when the trial was first created.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the bottom of the Trials frame is a button for &#8220;More&#8230;&#8221;, in the style of GitHub. Clicking this button scrolls the entire window down to display more trials. This button disappears once the researcher has displayed all existing trials. There is no scroll bar on the Trials frame itself.</p>

<p>At the top of the Trials frame is a button, &#8220;New Trial&#8221;. Clicking this button takes the researcher to the <strong>Create Trial</strong> page.</p>

<h3 id="feed">2. Feed</h3>

<p>The Feed is on the right side of <strong>Dashboard</strong>. This feed automatically updates with the following information regarding changes in status and other types of activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changes in status, with the following phrasing:

<ul>
<li>Awaiting players: &#8220;<strong>Trial ##</strong> has been created. Awaiting players.&#8221; As each player joins, the following message is displayed in the Feed: &#8220;<strong>Player ##</strong> has joined <strong>Trial ##</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>In progress: &#8220;<strong>Trial ##</strong>&#8221; is now in progress.</li>
<li>Pay subjects: &#8220;<strong>Trial ##</strong> has finished. Go to the <strong>Trial Summary</strong> page to review subject payments.&#8221;</li>
<li>Complete: &#8220;<strong>Trial ##</strong> is now complete.&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fork activity

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Researcher ## has just forked your experiment, <strong>Experiment Name</strong>.&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Following activity

<ul>
<li>&#8220;<strong>Researcher ##</strong> is now following <strong>Trial ##</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;You are now following <strong>Trial ##</strong> by <strong>Researcher ##</strong>.&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Each bolded item in the above bulleted list should be a link that opens in a new tab. <strong>Trial ##</strong> links to the <strong>Trial Summary</strong> page for a particular trial. <strong>Player ##</strong> links to a player profile, which is hosted externally on the Player Website. <strong>Researcher ##</strong> links to the public profile view of another researcher; this profile is hosted on the Researcher Site.</p>

<p>Just as with the Trials frame, a &#8220;More&#8230;&#8221; button below the Feed frame scrolls down the entire window and allows the researcher to see more feed information.</p>

<p>The Header and Footer of <strong>Dashboard</strong> are identical to the logged-in view in <strong>Experiments Library</strong>. <!---internal link--></p>

<h2 id="anamersexperiment_pageaexperimentpage"><a name="RSExperiment_page"></a>Experiment page</h2>

<p>The <strong>Experiment</strong> page is the same thing as the <strong>Create Trial</strong> page described in the original <a href="https://github.com/Experiments/popper-design/blob/master/popper_brief.md">Popper brief</a>. </p>

<p>This page describes the experiment and allows the user to run a trial of the experiment. <strong>Experiment</strong> consists of four components:</p>

<ol>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Footer</li>
<li>Experiment Description</li>
<li>Create Trial</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="header">1. Header</h3>

<p>Logged in users see the same Header as the logged in version described in Experiment Library. Logged out users see the Header described in the landing page. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="footer">2. Footer</h3>

<p>The Footer is the same as the one described on previous pages. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="experimentdescription">3. Experiment Description</h3>

<p>Popper reads the metadata file from the experiment GitHub repository to dynamically generate the Experiment Description. The metadata file itself is generated using the <strong>Experiment Parameters</strong> form on the Popper website. This page of the site does not need to be designed, since it should use the same design as the Sign Up page. We would like to provide users with a stock list of parameters that usually accompany any experiment, but also give users the flexibility to omit and add fields as necessary. A user should also be able to click &#8220;Edit&#8221; next to a field to change portions of the Experiment Description if the experiment came from this user&#8217;s repository. Even if an experiment is public, the Experiment Description is read-only for users who do not own the GitHub experiment repository, and these users do not see &#8220;Edit&#8221; next to any of the fields. </p>

<p>Here is a preliminary list of stock fields that we suggest accompany all experiments.</p>

<p><strong>User provided</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Name of the experiment.</li>
<li>Authors of the experiment with links to their Popper profiles. <!---internal link--></li>
<li>Description of the experiment.</li>
<li>References.</li>
<li>IRB approval(s): All social science research conducted in the United States receiving federal funding requires an IRB approval form before the researcher can conduct the experiment. It would be up to the researcher to make sure that the appropriate form is complete and attached, since Popper is not responsible or liable for monitoring the IRB approval process for researchers.</li>
<li>Categories: We will provide a list of categories for each field. As the user begins typing, this field would provide suggested categories in &#8220;tag&#8221; form. The researcher would also be able to enter other categories that are not included in our suggestions. The purpose of categories is to sort experiments so that they are searchable using the Filter tool in the Experiment Library.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Automatically generated for all experiments</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Original repository, if the experiment repository was forked</li>
<li>Link to GitHub repository holding the experiment</li>
<li>Automatically generated &#8220;citation link&#8221; of the form &#8220;http://expt.cc/######&#8221;, where # is a randomly generated digit. This citation link is a short URL to the <strong>Experiment Page</strong> for an experiment</li>
<li>Discussion: Researchers should be able to post comments about an experiment. A user must be logged in to leave comments, as we would like to make sure comments are made by actual researchers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="createtrial">4. Create Trial</h3>

<p>As with Experiment Description, Create Trial is generated based on what the user specifies in the <strong>Experiment Parameters</strong> form. Users would be able to add to or delete from a stock list of parameters for a trial. Here is the list of suggested parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of subjects</li>
<li>Cost of cooperation</li>
<li>Multiplier</li>
<li>Continuation probability</li>
<li>Initial endowment</li>
<li>Exchange rate (points to dollars)</li>
<li>Frame (different visualizations of the game)</li>
<li>Subjects (the pool of subjects for the trial)</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Option to make trial results public</li>
<li>Connection speed</li>
<li>Connection latency</li>
</ul>

<p>Below the create trial box is a list of previous trials that were run using the same experiment. Clicking on the name of the trial brings the user to the <strong>Trial Results</strong> page, which is accessible only if the user ran the trial or if the trial results are made public. Clicking on the name of the researcher brings the user to the researcher&#8217;s Popper <strong>Profile</strong>.</p>

<p>Create Trial must be able to accomodate a wide range of parameters because experiments differ greatly. Since the parameters depend on the coding of the master client and client files of the experiment, the researcher would know what parameters are necessary and what parameters the server would accept as inputs based on the design of the experiment. </p>

<h2 id="anamerstrial_summaryatrialsummary"><a name="RSTrial_summary"></a>Trial summary</h2>

<p>The <strong>Trial Summary</strong> is the same as the <strong>Monitor Trial</strong> page described in the original <a href="https://github.com/Experiments/popper-design/blob/master/popper_brief.md">Popper brief</a>. This page allows the researcher to monitor an individual trial in real time and download the results once the trial is complete. <strong>Trial Summary</strong> consists of six components:</p>

<ol>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Footer</li>
<li>Trial Information</li>
<li>Players</li>
<li>Report</li>
<li>History</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="header">1. Header</h3>

<p>See above. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="footer">2. Footer</h3>

<p>See above. <!---internal link--></p>

<h3 id="trialinformation">3. Trial Information</h3>

<ul>
<li>Name of the experiment: Clicking on this link brings the user to the <strong>Experiment Page</strong> for this particular experiment.</li>
<li>Trial number: For reference purposes. Trials are numbered in the order that they are created on Popper.org.</li>
<li>Start: Initiate the server instance and begin the trial.</li>
<li>Stop: End the trial manually.</li>
<li>Pause: Suspend the trial temporarily.</li>
<li>Replicate: The user is brought to the <strong>Experiment</strong> page for this trial with all fields in Create Trial already filled in. All the user needs to do is click &#8220;Create Trial&#8221; to replicate the trial, or change parameters if desired.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="players">4. Players</h3>

<p>The researcher can see a list of all subjects who have participated or are currently participating in the trial. The following stock parameters are suggested but can be added to or deleted on the <strong>Experiment Parameters</strong> page.</p>

<ul>
<li>Player ID: The researcher does not know subject names. Clicking on the Player ID of a subject brings the user to the public player profile on the Popper Player Website, which will be discussed later.</li>
<li>Status: A player who has the game open in the player&#8217;s current browser tab is <code>Active</code>. A player who navigates to a different browser tab is <code>inactive</code>. A player who prematurely closes the browser tab to leave the trial has <code>Dropped out</code>.</li>
<li>Stage: If there are multiple steps in the trial, the researcher can see how far each subject has progressed.</li>
<li>IP address: The user can prevent cheating by checking whether multiple users are actually playing from the same IP address.</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Earnings</li>
<li>Approved: The researcher approves subject payments buy clicking the checkbox next to a player&#8217;s earnings. This option is not available until the trial ends or the researcher manually clicks &#8220;Stop&#8221; to end the trial.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="report">5. Report</h3>

<p>The Report is a list of purely quantitative data. The data collected for each trial is specified by the user. At the conclusion of a trial, the user can download the data in the form of a .csv, .xls, or .pdf file. Here are suggested types of data that users collect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage</li>
<li>Player</li>
<li>Choice: Can be a binary variable but does not have to be; its significance is specified by the user in the source code of the experiment and on the <strong>Experiment Parameters</strong> page.</li>
<li>Duration: The amount of time that it took for a player to make a particular choice.</li>
<li>Balance: A snapshot of the player&#8217;s current points balance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history">6. History</h3>

<p>The History is a qualitative description of the events of the trial. Like the Report, the output of the History of a trial depends on what the user specifies. Regardless of these specifications, the history should include at the minimum the Timestamp of an event and the name of the event.</p>

<h1> <a name="Player_Site"></a>Player Site </h1>

<p>Players (subjects) play games on the Popper Player Website to contribute to social science research. Most social science experiments are currently run in social science laboratories, where players type information into a screen like the following.</p>

<!---z-tree screenshot-->

<h2 id="anamepsaudienceaaudience"><a name="PSAudience"></a>Audience</h2>

<p>Researchers recruit subjects from three sources: </p>

<ol>
<li>Online labor markets, like <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> and <a href="www.odesk.com">oDesk</a>.</li>
<li>Their own subject pools.</li>
<li>Visitors who independently come to the Popper Player Site.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="anamepsaccountsaaccounts"><a name="PSAccounts"></a>Accounts</h2>

<p>All players must have an account to play games on the Popper Player Website, since demographic information about the player, like age and sex, are usually necessary for the researcher to interpret results. Players cannot be anonymous. On the same token, player confidentiality is important and researchers should not know all information about their subjects. Player privacy, especially their names, should be protected so that players feel that they are making decisions in the game safely without the risk of stigma or judgment. For example, a player who chooses to &#8220;betray&#8221; other players in a game should be able to do so without worrying that the researcher or other players would be able to identify them in real life. </p>

<h3 id="login">Log In</h3>

<p>The landing page of the Popper Player Website is a Log In page. Players should not be able to see games unless they log in with a verified Popper account. <!--- internal link--></p>

<p>Players must log in by using their Facebook account. We want to make sure that demographic information associated with each player is as accurate as possible, which is easier if the player logs in using an account linked with his real identity. Logging in with a Facebook account also reduces the amount of demographic information that the player has to provide manually, since the Player Site can pull the player&#8217;s name, age, and sex from the player&#8217;s Facebook account. The player is notified with a message on the Log In page that his individual choices in a game (for example, defection or cooperation) will never be publicized. This assurance is necessary so that the player does not alter his behavior based on the possibility that his friends will see how he played certain games.</p>

<p>We are considering making the background of the Log In page a blurry version of the Lobby, to give players an idea of what lies in the Player Website.</p>

<h3 id="signup">Sign Up</h3>

<p>The player is taken through the standard Facebook authorization process, and must allow Popper to post messages on the player&#8217;s timeline saying that the player just played game XYZ. If the Player Website is unable to pull certain information from the player&#8217;s Facebook page, the player sees a final screen, which asks the player to provide an age and sex so that the player is served a list of games that match the player&#8217;s demographics. Other more detailed information is solicited from games on an as-needed basis, before the player begins the game.</p>

<p>Like the Log In page, the Sign Up page should feature the same blurry version of the Lobby.</p>

<h2 id="anamepslobbyalobby"><a name="PSLobby"></a>Lobby</h2>

<p>The lobby is a dynamic gallery of every game that fits a player&#8217;s demographic information. It features two types of games: non-paying and paying. Non-paying games are two stock games that we hope to develop, that attract and retain a core group of players. The purpose of non-paying games is to provide players with an available game even when no trials are running. At least initially, we anticipate that the Player Site will not feature a paying game 24/7. Hosting two 24/7 games thus appeals to the third type of subject mentioned above, those who independently come to the Player Site. </p>

<p>Players see the following information about each game:</p>

<ul>
<li>Payoff range</li>
<li>Brief description, provided by the researcher</li>
<li>Number of participants</li>
<li>Time stamp of when the trial was initiated</li>
<li>A button to play the game</li>
</ul>

<p>When the player clicks the play button, the Player Site checks whether the player&#8217;s available demographic information matches what the researcher is looking for and asks the player to enter any additional demographic information that the researcher needs. These answers are then stored in the user&#8217;s account and cannot be manually altered by the player. If the player&#8217;s information does not match what the researcher is seeking, the player is alerted that he does not qualify for the game. We would like to minimize how often players see this message. As a player fills out more questionnaires prior to playing a game, more information will be gathered about the player and unsuitable games will not be displayed to the player in the first place.
If the player selects a paying game but has not entered payment information (in order to get paid), the player is redirected to the Profile, where he can enter information to link his Popper account with his PayPal, Amazon Mechanical Turk, or oDesk account.</p>

<h2 id="anamepsgameagame"><a name="PSGame"></a>Game</h2>

<p>The game page is an imbedded iframe featuring the client, which is designed by the researcher.</p>

<h2 id="anamepsprofileaprofile"><a name="PSProfile"></a>Profile</h2>

<p>The player profile features the individual&#8217;s name and payment information. Details like age and sex cannot be altered once the player has provided it or once it has been pulled from Facebook. In order to get paid, a player can enter his PayPal, Amazon Mechanical Turk, or oDesk information. </p>

<h2 id="anamepsaboutaabout"><a name="PSAbout"></a>About</h2>

<p>The About page is static and features a description of the Player Site and how players contribute to social science research by playing games. </p>
